Sprint 1: Core Backend API & Security Setup
Goal: Establish a solid backend foundation by implementing REST API endpoints for the core models and securing them using Auth0 JWT validation.

Tasks:

Project Organization & Setup

Task 1.1:
Create a dedicated API/Controller structure within the backend directory (e.g., backend/api/).
Set up separate modules for User, Club, and Membership endpoints.

Authentication Integration (Backend)

Task 1.2:
Implement a FastAPI dependency in a file (e.g., backend/auth.py) to verify JWT tokens against Auth0. Retrieve the JWKS and set up the token validation logic.
Ensure environment variables (e.g., Auth0 domain, audience) are properly configured.

CRUD Endpoints for Core Models

Task 1.3:
Develop CRUD endpoints for Users:

GET /users for listing users (with optional filtering by Auth0 ID).

POST /users to register new users.

PUT /users/{id} and DELETE /users/{id} for updating and removing users respectively.
Use Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.

Task 1.4:
Develop CRUD endpoints for Clubs:

POST /clubs for club creation (validate that the creator is set as the owner).

GET /clubs and GET /clubs/{id} for retrieval.

PUT and DELETE operations as needed, ensuring proper role-based authorization.*

Task 1.5:
Develop endpoints for Memberships:

POST /memberships to add a user to a club.

GET /memberships to list memberships per user/club.

Optionally, PUT for updating roles/status and DELETE for removal.*

Testing & Documentation

Task 1.6:
Write unit tests (using pytest) for each endpoint to ensure proper response codes and validations. Create tests under a dedicated backend/tests/ directory.

Task 1.7:
Document the API endpoints with inline comments and, if possible, leverage FastAPIâ€™s autogenerated Swagger UI for interactive documentation. Provide sample CURL commands for each endpoint.

Sprint 2: Extended Backend for Investment Operations
Goal: Build out the business logic supporting investment management features such as funds, portfolios, transactions, and discussions.

Tasks:

Funds and Fund Memberships

Task 2.1:
Implement CRUD endpoints for Funds:

POST /funds to create funds.

GET /funds and GET /funds/{id} for querying funds.

PUT and DELETE for updates and removal.
Ensure each Fund is associated with a Club and validates the owner/manager permissions.

Task 2.2:
Create endpoints to manage Fund Memberships similar to Club Memberships (e.g., POST /fund-memberships for joining a fund and GET for listing memberships).

Portfolio Management

Task 2.3:
Implement endpoints for Portfolios:

Since a fund has a unique portfolio, create a GET endpoint (e.g., /portfolios/{fund_id}) to fetch portfolio data.

POST endpoint to initialize a portfolio if not already created.*

Positions, Transactions, and Income

Task 2.4:
Develop endpoints for Positions:

GET /positions and POST /positions to create and update positions based on trades/investment decisions.*

Task 2.5:
Implement Transaction endpoints:

POST /transactions to record a new transaction including type, quantity, and price.

GET /transactions to list historical transaction records.*

Task 2.6:
Implement endpoints for Income and Performance Snapshots:

POST /incomes for recording dividends or interest incomes.

GET /performance-snapshots to retrieve aggregated performance metrics.*

Community Engagement (Optional)

Task 2.7:
If time allows, add endpoints for Discussion and Comment management:

POST /discussions to create forum topics and POST /comments to reply.

Testing & Documentation

Task 2.8:
Write comprehensive unit tests for each investment-related endpoint under backend/tests/.

Task 2.9:
Update API documentation and make sure that each new endpoint is clearly explained and accessible via the Swagger UI.

Sprint 3: Frontend Integration & UI Enhancements
Goal: Connect the enhanced backend with the frontend and build out user interfaces for club, fund, and portfolio management.

Tasks:

API Client & Service Layer in Frontend

Task 3.1:
Create a dedicated API client in the frontend (using axios/fetch) to interact with backend endpoints. Organize service functions (e.g., fetchUser, createClub, getFundDetails).

Task 3.2:
Integrate TanStack Query to manage data fetching, caching, and state for backend calls.

Dashboard and Club Management UI

Task 3.3:
Enhance the Dashboard page to list user-specific details such as clubs and funds the user is associated with.

Task 3.4:
Develop dedicated Club Management components:

A form to create a new club (with validation, error handling).

A list view to display the clubs with options to edit or leave a club.*

Fund and Portfolio Interfaces

Task 3.5:
Build views for Fund management:

List funds, view detailed information, and facilitate joining funds.

Integrate a view to display the associated Portfolio and Positions.*

Task 3.6:
Develop components to record Transactions and view Income/Performance snapshots. Include visual feedback (loading indicators, error messages) as data is fetched or updated.

Security & Navigation

Task 3.7:
*Ensure that all frontend API requests include proper authentication headers (using the Auth0 token from the React SDK).

Protect routes using React Router guards to prevent unauthorized access.*

Testing & Frontend Quality Assurance

Task 3.8:
Write integration tests for your React components using React Testing Library to ensure that the API connection, state management, and user interactions work as expected.

Sprint 4: End-to-End Testing, Refinement & Deployment
Goal: Finalize the project by undertaking comprehensive testing, code refinements, security audits, and preparing for deployment.

Tasks:

End-to-End & Integration Testing

Task 4.1:
Implement end-to-end (E2E) tests using a tool like Cypress to simulate user workflows (login, club creation, joining funds, recording a transaction).

Task 4.2:
Conduct integration testing on key API endpoints (using tools like Postman) to ensure the backend behaves as expected and handles error cases well.

Code Quality & Documentation

Task 4.3:
*Review and refactor the codebase for both backend and frontend, ensuring the code is modular, well-commented, and follows best practices.

Update the README and developer documentation with clear setup and usage instructions.*

Deployment Setup

Task 4.4:
Prepare Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend. Set up a docker-compose.yml for local development and staging deployments.

Task 4.5:
Configure a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) to automate testing and deployment, including proper handling of environment variables and secrets.

Security & Performance Audits

Task 4.6:
Review all security configurations (CORS policies, token validations, secret management) and ensure that the production environment is hardened against common vulnerabilities.

Task 4.7:
Run performance benchmarks and adjust database indexing or API optimizations as needed.

Final Release Preparation

Task 4.8:
Ensure all user-facing documentation is complete, and conduct a final round of manual testing before releasing a production build.

Additional Considerations
Iteration & Feedback: Each sprint should include a review phase where you check integration between backend and frontend, validate assumptions around security/authentication, and adapt your sprint tasks based on any discovered gaps.

Task Granularity: The tasks are designed to be atomic and clear so that if you use an AI coding agent, each task is small enough to be executed without ambiguity.

Documentation & Testing: Emphasize documentation and automated tests during every sprint to ensure robust, maintainable code as new features are added.
