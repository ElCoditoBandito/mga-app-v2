# Progress

[2025-04-20 13:58:30] - **Fixed Fund Memberships Test Issues**

Successfully fixed failing tests in the fund memberships module by:
1. Adding missing fixtures to test functions to ensure proper database setup
2. Creating a new `seed_test_club_membership` fixture to establish club membership for fund members
3. Fixing parameter mismatches in the CRUD function calls

All tests are now passing successfully, ensuring proper authentication and authorization for fund membership operations.

[2025-04-20 10:02:38] - **Completed TestClient Initialization Refactoring**

Successfully refactored the TestClient initialization in conftest.py to address persistent 404 errors in API tests. The changes include:

1. Removed the global import of app from the top of conftest.py
2. Added the import inside the client fixture function
3. Modified the client fixture to return a dictionary with both app and client
4. Updated all other fixtures that use the client fixture to extract the app and client from the dictionary

This change ensures that the TestClient is always created with the fully configured application instance, which should resolve the 404 errors in API tests.

[2025-04-19 10:58:00] - Completed migration of Pydantic v1 style validators to v2 style validators in the following files:
- `backend/schemas/position.py` (4 validators)
- `backend/schemas/transaction.py` (3 validators)
- `backend/schemas/income.py` (2 validators)
- `backend/schemas/performance_snapshot.py` (3 validators)

All tests are now passing without warnings.
