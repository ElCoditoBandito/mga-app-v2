## Priority 1.2 Calculation Features

This bundle of features focuses on accurate financial calculations and market data integration:

1. **Current Market Price Integration:**
   * Integrate a reliable system/service for fetching current market prices for all tradable assets
   * Consider API options (Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, Polygon.io, etc.)
   * Implement API key management, rate limiting, data refresh strategy
   * Handle cases where assets are not found

2. **Accurate Position Valuation:**
   * Update backend logic to use fetched market prices for position valuation
   * Modify `fund_service.get_fund_detailed` and reporting services
   * Calculate true market value as `Current Market Price * Quantity`
   * Update derived metrics (total fund value, percentage of club assets)

3. **Profit & Loss (P&L) Calculation Logic:**
   * Implement backend logic for P&L calculations
   * Unrealized P&L: `(Current Market Price - Weighted Average Cost Basis) * Quantity`
   * Realized P&L: Calculate gain/loss when positions are sold
   * Maintain weighted average cost in `Position.average_cost_basis` field
   * Determine accounting method (FIFO, LIFO, or average cost)
   * Design P&L display (per position, per fund, per club, over time periods)

4. **Option Valuation Strategy:**
   * Implement proper valuation for options in portfolios
   * Either fetch market prices for options or implement valuation models
   * Consider Black-Scholes or other suitable models for OTC/less liquid options
   * Integrate option values into position market values and P&L calculations

5. **Frontend Display of Accurate Calculations:**
   * Update frontend components to display new calculations
   * Focus on `FundDetailPage.tsx`, `PortfolioPage.tsx`, and dashboard sections
   * Ensure consistent display of market values and P&L figures
