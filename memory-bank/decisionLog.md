## Decision: Async SQLAlchemy for Database Operations

* **Rationale**:
  * Improved scalability and performance for concurrent requests
  * Better resource utilization during I/O-bound operations
  * Consistent with FastAPI's async-first approach

* **Implementation Details**:
  * Using SQLAlchemy's async extension
  * AsyncSession for all database operations
  * Async context managers for session management
  * Explicit await for all database operations

## Decision: Auth0 for Authentication

* **Rationale**:
  * Secure, industry-standard authentication service
  * Offloads complex auth management to a specialized service
  * Provides JWT tokens with standard claims
  * Supports social logins and enterprise connections

* **Implementation Details**:
  * JWT validation using JWKS from Auth0
  * Token caching to reduce external API calls
  * Mapping Auth0 users to internal user records
  * Email claim required in tokens
  * First name and last name extracted from given_name and family_name claims

## Decision: Unit-based Equity Tracking

* **Rationale**:
  * Standard approach for investment clubs
  * Allows for fair distribution of gains/losses
  * Supports partial ownership and flexible contributions
  * Simplifies member equity calculations

* **Implementation Details**:
  * NAV calculation based on asset prices and cash
  * Unit value history tracked over time
  * Member transactions affect unit balances
  * Deposits issue new units, withdrawals redeem units

## Decision: Multi-Fund Structure

* **Rationale**:
  * Allows clubs to organize investments by strategy or asset class
  * Supports different allocation strategies
  * Enables tracking performance by fund

* **Implementation Details**:
  * Funds belong to clubs
  * Fund splits define allocation percentages
  * Positions and transactions linked to specific funds
  * Cash tracked at both club and fund levels

## Decision: Layered Architecture

* **Rationale**:
  * Clear separation of concerns
  * Testability of individual components
  * Maintainability and code organization
  * Consistent patterns across the application

* **Implementation Details**:
  * API Layer: FastAPI routers and endpoints
  * Service Layer: Business logic and orchestration
  * CRUD Layer: Database operations
  * Model Layer: SQLAlchemy models

## Decision: Option Valuation Strategy for MVP

* **Rationale**:
  * Current accounting_service returns 0.0 for option prices
  * Accurate NAV calculation requires option valuation
  * MVP needs a practical solution before launch

* **Implementation Details**:
  * For MVP: Implement manual price entry for options during transaction logging
  * Store last known price in the asset record
  * Use last known price for NAV calculations
  * Future enhancement: Integrate with options pricing API or implement Black-Scholes model

## Decision: Frontend-Backend Integration Approach

* **Rationale**:
  * Frontend currently uses mock data
  * Need efficient data fetching and state management
  * Consistent error handling across application

* **Implementation Details**:
  * Implement React Query for server state management
  * Create custom hooks for each API endpoint
  * Standardize error handling and loading states
  * Implement optimistic updates where appropriate

## Decision: Priority 1.2 Calculation Features Bundle

* **Rationale**:
  * These calculation features are closely related and interdependent
  * They represent core financial functionality needed for accurate portfolio valuation and performance tracking
  * Bundling them allows for coordinated implementation and testing
  * They should be implemented after the current smaller P1 items are completed

* **Implementation Details**:
  * Current Market Price Integration will serve as the foundation for other calculation features
  * Position.average_cost_basis field will be used to maintain weighted average cost basis
  * Accounting_service will be responsible for updating the average cost basis during transactions
  * P&L calculations will use the weighted average purchase price as the cost basis
  * Resolve inconsistency between Position.average_cost_basis (model) and position.average_price (referenced in code)

## Decision: Eager Loading for Nested Relationships in API Responses

* **Rationale**:
  * Prevents `MissingGreenlet` errors during response serialization
  * Ensures complete data is available for API responses
  * Avoids lazy loading attempts during serialization which can fail in async contexts
  * Improves API reliability and error handling

* **Implementation Details**:
  * Modified `process_member_deposit` in `accounting_service.py` to re-fetch created transactions with relationships
  * Used SQLAlchemy's `selectinload` to eagerly load `membership` and `membership.club` relationships
  * Implemented a pattern that can be reused for other endpoints with nested relationships
  * Removed problematic `db.refresh()` calls that could trigger lazy loading

## Decision: Enhanced Auth0 User Profile Integration

* **Rationale**:
  * Improves user experience by displaying proper names instead of "undefined undefined"
  * Leverages standard Auth0 profile claims for consistent user data
  * Maintains data consistency between Auth0 and application database
  * Reduces need for users to re-enter information already in Auth0

* **Implementation Details**:
  * Added `first_name` and `last_name` fields to `User` model and database schema
  * Created and applied Alembic migration to update database structure
  * Added fields to Pydantic schemas for API validation/serialization
  * Enhanced `JWTPayload` model to extract `given_name` and `family_name` claims from Auth0 tokens
  * Modified user service to accept and store these names during user creation

## Decision: Robust Frontend Data Type Handling

* **Rationale**:
  * Prevents display issues with financial data
  * Handles inconsistencies between API response formats and frontend expectations
  * Improves reliability of calculations involving monetary values
  * Ensures consistent user experience across the application

* **Implementation Details**:
  * Modified transaction type comparisons to use case-insensitive matching
  * Added explicit type conversion for monetary values using `parseFloat(String(value))`
  * Implemented `isNaN` checks to handle potential parsing failures gracefully
  * Standardized approach for handling API data that may have inconsistent types

## Decision: Consistent Role Handling with Centralized Enums

* **Rationale**:
  * Prevents inconsistencies in role-based access control
  * Eliminates bugs caused by string case mismatches
  * Centralizes enum definitions for better maintainability
  * Ensures consistent behavior across the application

* **Implementation Details**:
  * Identified incorrect uppercase string comparisons for roles (e.g., `member.role === 'ADMIN'`) in `FundsPage.tsx` and `MembersPage.tsx`
  * Removed local, incorrect `ClubRole` enum in `MembersPage.tsx`
  * Refactored code to correctly import and use the centralized `ClubRole` enum from `frontend/src/enums.ts`
  * Ensured all role checks use the enum values (e.g., `ClubRole.Admin` which is `'Admin'`) rather than hardcoded strings
  * Standardized role comparison approach across components

## Decision: Transaction Type Display Standardization

* **Rationale**:
  * Ensures consistent financial representation in the UI
  * Aligns display with accounting principles (debits reduce balances, credits increase them)
  * Improves user understanding of transaction effects
  * Maintains consistency between backend logic and frontend display

* **Implementation Details**:
  * Fixed "Log Club Expense" transactions display in `ClubAccountingPage.tsx`
  * Modified rendering logic to ensure `'ClubExpense'` transactions are always shown in the "Debited (-)" column
  * Ensured transaction types are consistently handled regardless of amount sign
  * Maintained functional correctness while improving visual representation

## Decision: Complete Inter-Fund Cash Transfer Implementation

* **Rationale**:
  * Enables critical functionality for fund management
  * Resolves data flow issues between frontend and backend
  * Ensures consistent handling of transfer parameters
  * Completes the cash transfer feature set

* **Implementation Details**:
  * Initial fix: Added `target_fund_id` field to the `CashTransferData` interface in `frontend/src/lib/apiClient.ts`
  * Final fix: Updated `handleLogCashTransferSubmit` function in `frontend/src/pages/ClubAccountingPage.tsx` to correctly pass `target_fund_id` to the mutation
  * Verified complete data flow from form collection through API client to backend endpoint
  * Confirmed backend schema (`TransactionCreateCashTransfer`) and service (`process_cash_transfer_transaction`) correctly handle the parameter
