## Current Focus

* Completing the MVP with full frontend-backend integration (Priority 1)
* Focusing on remaining MVP Priority 1 items:
  * Fetch live unit value for Members Page equity calculation
  * Fetch/display actual balances on Funds Page cards
  * Implement holdings filtering on Fund Detail Page
  * Implement "Log Trade" button on Fund Detail Page
* Planning for Priority 1.2 Calculation Features implementation
* Implementing option valuation strategy for NAV calculations
* Preparing for comprehensive end-to-end testing
* Setting up deployment infrastructure

## Recent Changes

* **Bug Fixes:**
  * Fixed Admin role functionality in `FundsPage.tsx` and `MembersPage.tsx` by correctly importing and using the centralized `ClubRole` enum from `frontend/src/enums.ts` (2025-05-14 05:43:00)
  * Fixed "Log Club Expense" transactions display in `ClubAccountingPage.tsx` to correctly show as "Debit" instead of "Credit" (2025-05-14 05:43:00)
  * Fixed inter-fund cash transfer functionality by updating `handleLogCashTransferSubmit` in `ClubAccountingPage.tsx` to correctly pass `target_fund_id` to the mutation (2025-05-14 05:43:00)
  * Fixed MissingGreenlet error in member deposit API endpoint by implementing eager loading for membership.club relationship in accounting_service.py (2025-05-12 20:48:46)
  * Fixed "undefined undefined" user name display issue by adding first_name and last_name fields to User model, database schema, and Pydantic models (2025-05-12 21:30:00)
  * Fixed frontend display issues in ClubAccountingPage.tsx where bank balance showed $0.00 and deposits were displayed as withdrawals (2025-05-12 21:32:00)
  * Fixed initial inter-fund cash transfer functionality by adding `target_fund_id` field to the `CashTransferData` interface in `frontend/src/lib/apiClient.ts` (2025-05-13 14:42:47)

* **Backend Analysis Completed:**
  * Models (models/): Core SQLAlchemy models defined with relationships, constraints, enums, and timestamps
  * Schemas (schemas/): Pydantic schemas for API validation/serialization
  * CRUD Layer (crud/): CRUD functions implemented for core models using async patterns
  * Service Layer (services/): Core business logic implemented for user, asset, club, transaction, accounting, reporting, fund, and fund split management
  * API Layer (api/v1/): Routers structured with core endpoints for MVP features
  * Authentication (api/dependencies.py): Real Auth0 token validation integrated with first_name/last_name support
  * Authorization: Role-based access control implemented with dependencies
  * Testing: Robust async DB setup with migrations, CRUD tests passing, service layer tests refactored

* **Frontend Analysis Completed:**
  * React/TypeScript structure with routing and protected routes
  * Auth0 integration with organization support
  * API client implementation
  * UI shells for pages and forms using shadcn/ui components

* **Frontend Integration Status:**
  * **Foundation:** React Query setup, API client, React Query hooks (`useApi.ts`) are complete
  * **Data Display Pages:**
    * `PortfolioPage`: Complete
    * `ClubDashboardPage`: Partially complete (Recent Activity, detailed Fund Overview need connection)
    * `BrokerageLogPage`: Complete (Optional: server-side pagination, option expiration endpoint)
    * `MembersPage`: Partially complete (Equity value needs live unit value)
    * `FundsPage`: Partially complete (Fund card balances need connection)
    * `FundDetailPage`: Mostly complete (Holdings need filtering, "Log Trade" button needs implementation)
  * **Transaction Logging Forms:**
    * Stock Trade, Option Trade, Dividend/Interest, Cash Transfer (Bank/Brokerage), Member Deposit/Withdrawal: Complete
    * Club Expense: Not implemented
  * **Asset Creation/Selection:** Complete

## Open Questions/Issues

* **Priority 1.2 Calculation Features:**
  * Which market data API should be selected for current price integration? (Alpha Vantage has rate limits)
  * Which accounting method should be used for realized P&L calculations (FIFO, LIFO, or average cost)?
  * What valuation model is most appropriate for options that don't have readily available market prices?
  * How to handle the inconsistency between `position.average_cost_basis` (model) and `position.average_price` (referenced in code)?

* **Option Valuation for NAV:** The accounting_service currently returns 0.0 for option prices. A strategy is needed for MVP.
* **Alpha Vantage API Limits:** Potential operational concern for market data in production.
* **Remaining Frontend Integration Work (MVP Priority 1):**
  * Fetch live unit value for Members Page equity calculation
  * Fetch/display actual balances on Funds Page cards
  * Implement holdings filtering on Fund Detail Page
  * Implement "Log Trade" button on Fund Detail Page
  * Connect "Recent Activity" on Club Dashboard
  * ✅ Admin role functionality in FundsPage.tsx and MembersPage.tsx
  * ✅ Club Expense display in ClubAccountingPage.tsx
  * ✅ Inter-fund cash transfer functionality
  * ✅ Implement full stack for "Log Club Expense"
  * ✅ Refine Dashboard Cash Transfer handler
* Potential performance optimizations for large clubs or high transaction volumes
* Long-term data retention and archiving policies
* Backup and disaster recovery procedures
* Deployment strategy and infrastructure requirements
