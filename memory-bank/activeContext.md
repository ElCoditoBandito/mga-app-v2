## Recent Changes

[2025-04-20 13:57:00] - **Fixed Fund Memberships Test Issues**

Fixed failing tests in the fund memberships module by addressing several issues:
1. Added missing fixtures to the test functions to ensure proper database setup
2. Created a new `seed_test_club_membership` fixture to establish club membership for fund members
3. Fixed parameter mismatches in the CRUD function calls

All tests are now passing successfully, ensuring proper authentication and authorization for fund membership operations.

[2025-04-20 10:02:28] - **TestClient Initialization Refactored**

Refactored the TestClient initialization in conftest.py to address persistent 404 errors in API tests. The app is now imported inside the client fixture function rather than at the module level, ensuring the TestClient is always created with the fully configured application instance. This should resolve issues where API tests were failing with 404 errors despite correct route definitions and prefixes.

*   [2025-04-18 17:48:00] - Created SPRINT2_PLAN.md with a detailed execution plan for Sprint 2:
    *   Defined implementation order: Funds → Portfolios → Positions → Transactions → Income/Performance Snapshots → (Optional) Discussions
    *   Specified authorization rules for investment-related endpoints
    *   Created detailed task breakdowns with specific actions for each component
    *   Included implementation flow diagrams, authorization flow, and data flow for investment operations

## Sprint 1 Clarifications (2025-04-16 00:39:06)

*   **Auth0 Audience:** Required for backend API security. Needs to be configured in Auth0 (API settings) and added to the backend `.env` file. Guidance needed for setup.
*   **Database:** Confirmed setup with `DATABASE_URL` (asyncpg) and `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` (psycopg2). Migrations assumed functional.
*   **User Creation:** `POST /users` endpoint will sync user data from Auth0 *after* initial Auth0 signup/login. Frontend will likely trigger this if the user doesn't exist locally. Whitelisting approach for MVP is acceptable.
*   **Club Creation/Roles:** MVP focuses on a single club initially. `POST /clubs` will be used for manual creation (creator becomes owner). Future: Invite links/signup flow.
*   **Authorization:**
    *   Club Deletion: Only Club Owner.
    *   Membership Management (Add/Remove/Modify Roles): Club Owner or Admin.

## Database Migrations

*   **Migration Script:** The project includes a comprehensive migration script (`backend/scripts/run_all_migrations.py`) that:
    *   Runs Alembic migrations on both development and test databases.
    *   Provides detailed HTML error logging if migrations fail.
    *   Temporarily sets the correct database URL for the test environment.
    *   Should be used when implementing new models for Sprint 2 (Funds, Portfolios, etc.).

## Open Questions/Issues

*   Consider adding more robust error handling and validation.
*   Consider implementing pagination for list endpoints.
*   Consider adding filtering options for list endpoints.
