# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.
2025-05-05 08:32:00 - Initial creation based on project overview and codebase analysis.
2025-05-10 13:25:00 - Updated based on detailed frontend and backend code analysis.

## Current Focus

* Completing the MVP with full frontend-backend integration
* Implementing option valuation strategy for NAV calculations
* Preparing for comprehensive end-to-end testing
* Setting up deployment infrastructure

## Recent Changes

* **Backend Analysis Completed:**
  * Models (models/): Core SQLAlchemy models defined with relationships, constraints, enums, and timestamps
  * Schemas (schemas/): Pydantic schemas for API validation/serialization
  * CRUD Layer (crud/): CRUD functions implemented for core models using async patterns
  * Service Layer (services/): Core business logic implemented for user, asset, club, transaction, accounting, reporting, fund, and fund split management
  * API Layer (api/v1/): Routers structured with core endpoints for MVP features
  * Authentication (api/dependencies.py): Real Auth0 token validation integrated
  * Authorization: Role-based access control implemented with dependencies
  * Testing: Robust async DB setup with migrations, CRUD tests passing, service layer tests refactored

* **Frontend Analysis Completed:**
  * React/TypeScript structure with routing and protected routes
  * Auth0 integration with organization support
  * API client implementation
  * UI shells for pages and forms using shadcn/ui components
  * Currently using mock data instead of live API integration

## Open Questions/Issues

* **Option Valuation for NAV:** The accounting_service currently returns 0.0 for option prices. A strategy is needed for MVP.
* **Asset Creation Workflow:** Process for creating new assets encountered during transaction logging needs to be seamless between frontend and backend.
* **Alpha Vantage API Limits:** Potential operational concern for market data in production.
* **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Frontend pages and forms need to be connected to live backend APIs.
* **Server State Management:** Implementation needed for efficient data fetching and caching.
* Potential performance optimizations for large clubs or high transaction volumes
* Long-term data retention and archiving policies
* Backup and disaster recovery procedures
* Deployment strategy and infrastructure requirements
